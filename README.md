I'm Uduak, an upcoming Designer, Programmer, and Developer based in Nigeria. 
 
I consider myself a self-improver. So I tend to find myself learning whatever catches my interest and possibly tinkering with my newfound skills through projects. So if you see a lot of weird repos, you can get why...
 
I love playing games. and not mainstream or AAA games like COD and the likes. I'm more into chill games, nurture games, horror games, visual novels, indie games I found on itch. a bunch of stuff. 
Notable games are <i><b>Stardew Valley</b>, <b>Far Cry</b>, <b>Minecraft, FNAF, Danganronpa, Paranormasight</b></i>, and my ever-loving <i><b>[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19012724)</b></i>.

I'm trying to build my expertise on development, and so far I'm into <b>Godot</b> for game dev, <b>Flutter</b> for app dev, and <b>Canva</b> for design dev (lol, not a word, I know)

For now, this readme is just random stuff, but over time, hopefully, it'll become more professional when I'm finally part of the working class.
