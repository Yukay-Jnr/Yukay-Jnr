 I'm Uduak, an upcoming Designer, Programmer, and Developer based in Nigeria. 
 I consider myself a self-improver. So I tend to find myself learning whatever catches my interest and possibly tinkering with my newfound skills through projects. So if you see a lot of weird repos, you can get why...
 I looove playing games. and not mainstream or AAA games like COD and the likes. I'm more into chill games, nurture games, horror games, visual novels, indie games I found on itch. a bunch of stuff. Notable games are Stardew Valley, Far Cry, Minecraft, FNAF, Danganronpa, Paranormasight, and my ever-loving [osu]!.
I'm trying to build my expertise on development, and so far I'm into Godot for game dev, Flutter for app dev, and Canva for designer dev (lol, not a word, I know)
For now this readme is just random stuff, but over time, hopefully, it'll become more professional when I'm finally part of the working class.
